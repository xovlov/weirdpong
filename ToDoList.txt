ToDo:
—————————————————————————————

- Bounce of board physics
- Point counter / respond
- Trails + Halo + Light Flares
- Weird balls? -> fix start velocity settings
- Camera size / sprite size / layout  (I adjusted the camera and wall locations slightly - Ty)


Completed:
—————————————————————————————

- Periodically instantiate balls
- Set fixed aspect 
- Stop board from overscrolling (Boards now have rigidbody2D components)
- Wall sections change color, and changes ball color (This might be a bit too crazy as is, but fun)





Stretch goals:
—————————————————————————————

- sound effects
- strobe effects
- wall colour change
- Adapt keycodes to controllers
- "Press to start" / Start menu
